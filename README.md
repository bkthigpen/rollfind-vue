# RollFind Vue

## Overview
I created this project based off the [RollFind](https://rollfind.joshuasoileau.com/) app by [Joshua Soileau](https://github.com/JoshuaSoileau), with the main intent being to test out Vue 3's [Composition API](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/composition-api-introduction.html) on a scalable project. Look forward to future developments and features.
